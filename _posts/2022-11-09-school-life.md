Hi there! MC again. 2022 is a year of change to me. My school, my subjects studying, my jobs, my titles, my social circles, how I behave, how I look, my weight, my age... they have all changed. Alas! They changed so fast. Here I am writing for reflecting how I have done in 2022.

I am including reflections for a few aspects in my life this year.

# Friendship

It is great that I have made some new friends and became more outgoing than ever.
