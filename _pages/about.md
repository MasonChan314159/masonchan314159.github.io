Hi there! I am a 15-year-old Hongkonger. I am devoted to Maths and I have been doing Maths Olympiad since Form 1. I also do Physics, Linguistics and Informatics Olympiads.

Liking Maths to the full extent, I aspire to be a financial analyst or mathematician when I grow up. I am planning to study at the University of Cambridge or Oxford.

I like to solve Maths problems, read, and arrange scores on MuseScore. I also enjoy listening to national anthems worldwide. I sometimes play table tennis as well. I also own and/or run several Discord Servers.

This website is still under development. Feel free to drop me suggestions!
