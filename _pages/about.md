Hi there! I am a 15-year-old Hongkonger. I am a devotee to Maths and I have been doing Maths Olympiad since Form 1. I also do Physics, Linguistics and Informatics Olympiads.

Liking Maths to the full extent, I aspire to be a Financial analyst or Mathematician when I grow up. I am planning to study at the University of Cambridge.

I like to solve Maths problems, read and arrange scores on MuseScore. I also enjoy listening to national anthems worldwide, especially, the Romanian, Norwegian, French, and Soviet ones.

This website is still under development. Feel free to drop me suggestions!
