Having been devoted to Maths since childhood, I have joined numerous Maths competitions since I was in primary school. They range from regional contests, to international contests. Also, I have been a trainee of the IMO HK Training since 2021.

When I am free, I always do Maths problems (mainly the Olympiad ones).

I am a Mathematics Coordinator of the Joint School Mathematics Society.

The table below shows my achievements in Maths. Feel free to have a look at it!
