MC again. 2022 is a year of change to me. My school, my subjects studying, my jobs, my titles, my social circles, how I behave, how I look, my weight, my ageâ€¦ they have all changed. Alas! They changed so fast. Here I am writing for reflecting how I have done in 2022.</p> <p>I am including reflections for a few aspects in my life this year.</p> <h2 id="friendship">Friendship</h2> <p>It is great that I have made some new friends and became more outgoing than ever. I have known more people, not only those I have known from transferring to DBS, but also in other competitions and social gatherings. IMO Training, IPhO Training, APLO, SSPDOSA, and also some people that I reached out randomly (lol). That feels great when I expand my social circle.</p> <p>In particular, I have made some great friends in 2022, including Bosco Wang, Ian Pau and Astin Lo. They are really great friends of mine. How they are â€˜greatâ€™ are not only â€˜greatâ€™ academically, but also in character. They are all friendly, outgoing and it is great chatting with them. :D Of course, that also includes Daniel Roffey, which is quite a great friend of mine. He is quite humorous and he shares views that provoke my thinking. Jasmine Au, who is also a friend of mine, is caring and kind as well. :D Love you guys!</p> <p>There are also many orz figures I have known. As aforementioned, Bosco is an IOI awardee. Moreover, Fergus Lai, a friend of mine, was a 3-time IMO medalist, Kevin Xie, another friend of mine, got Gold in IOL and Silver in IOI. Brian Chau, another friend of mine, got into the International Brain Bee finalsâ€¦ It is great learning from them. orzzzz</p> <p>However, I (nearly) messed up a few friendships. I am sorry, Tom, that I sometimes behaved not so well and made you disappointed. Really sorry about it.</p> <p>Anyway, thank everyone who are my friend in the last year!</p> <h2 id="olympiads">Olympiads</h2> <h3 id="math-olympiad">Math Olympiad</h3> <p>This year is the second year for me in the IMO Training. It is great that I have grown up in the field of MO a lot in the past year.</p> <p>Going to the IMO Training is not only a matter of learning new MO techniques and ideas, but also a social gathering. I have known some friends from the IMO Training, and of course, they are all prodigies. It is great taking up the minds from them.</p> <p>Moreover, my MO performance was boosted by a lot. Last year, I only got 8+0+7 in the first three TST, while this year I think I got 20+16+17 (full marks: 42+28+28). Although I skill issued in all the tests (I actually could have AKed all the tests), it is already a great leap forward. However, to get into the IMO Alternate Team, effort must be paid, since there are many orz dudes this year (but also many not-so-orz dudes too). Best of luck to me!</p> <p>Sadly, I still could not get a good result in IMO HK Prelim. I skill issued a lot, and made a lot of careless mistakes. Else, I could have gotten a Silver.</p> <p>I joined AMC for the first time in life in November. I got a pretty good (?) result in AMC 10A - a shiny 108, but that was bad for me. I skill issued, and I could have gotten 141 if I performed the best, or 123 if I performed just better. However, that was enough for getting into AIME. For 12B, due to some issues, my results were not known yet, but I think I got a 90-something, which was quite bad. Hope I could do better in the following AIME.</p> <h3 id="physics-olympiad">Physics Olympiad</h3> <p>This year is also the second year for me in IPhO Training. It is also great I have grown up in the field of PhO a lot in the past year.</p> <p>I joined the IPhO Training (â€˜Physics Enhancement Programmeâ€™), but due to the time clash with the IMO Training, I only attended like 1/5 of all the lectures. To score well in the selection tests, I had to binge like 10 lecture notes within a week, twice! This was a torture to me. Luckily, I skill scored not bad - at least, enough for me to get into Phase 2.</p> <p>However, my main aim is not PhO, but MO and LO. I think I will quit in Phase 2 - I wonâ€™t be able to advance to Phase 3 anyways. I will still do HKPhO, SYPhO and Pan-Pearl though.</p> <p>My PhO performance was also boosted by a lot. I got a First Honour in the HKPhO 2022, which was better than in 2021, where I got a Second Honour only. I also got a Merit award in the SYPhO 2022, which is great (since I did not get anything in SYPhO 2021).</p> <h3 id="linguistics-olympiad">Linguistics Olympiad</h3> <p>2022 is the first year I do LO. Before that, I have no knowledge on what LO is, but I know some LO things, which apparently helped me in my LO career.</p> <p>I started LO since I searched up â€˜Kevin Xieâ€™ and found that he joined IOL 2021 and he got Gold, and then I tried the problems of HKLO, and they were not hard. Then, I started LO by applying for HKLO 2022 (I originally wanted to apply for HKLO training but I skill issued and it was already past the deadline). Although I had some prior knowledge of Linguistics, it was not enough for a Linguistics contest. Therefore, I have to self-study a lot of materials, and learn the Linguistics techniques by myself. This was not easy for me, but I strived to do my very best.</p> <p>The results were showed on my performance in HKLO 2022. I got Bronze (Rank 9/51), which was quite good and surprising for me. I didnâ€™t expect to get such a good prize, and was surprised that 50.xx marks were enough for Bronze. I was eligible to do the coming APLO 2022, and this motivated me to do even better in APLO 2022. Therefore, again, I went to numerous websites to polish my LO technique.</p> <p>Finally, I got Bronze (Rank 6/16 in HK; Rank 32 overall), which was quite good for me. Yet, it was a bit of a pity that I could not do the IOL 2022. Yet, I was not disappointed - I was a newbie, so it was normal for me not being able to do the IOL for the first year of getting engaged in LO.</p> <p>However, the tables had turned. Later, Kevin Xie reached out to me and asked if I was interested in doing the IOL 2022. He was asking so since he had to do PR China NOI 2022 (SPOILER: IT WAS LATER POSTPONED), and it clashed with IOL 2022, and Kevin chose to do NOI. However, my dad opposed to that for some reasons, and hence I had to give up the place as well.</p> <p>Hope that I could really make into the IOL Team this year. :)</p> <h3 id="informatics-olympiad">Informatics Olympiad</h3> <p>I started OI this year. I did not really know what OI is until the start of the year, when I joined the JSOI lockout Discord Server somehow. I then learned some OI things, and started learning C++. However, I did not know much in OI until I transferred to DBS - when Mr Chan, the TiC of MO and OI Team told me to do a Beginnersâ€™ Gym, where my OI techniques rocketed.</p> <p>However, my OI performance was still bad, as compared to other OIers who had more than one year of experience. Therefore, in minicomps, I always die/come at the last few places. Also, I had to rush and do 250 tasks on HKOI Judge, which took me a long while to finish.</p> <p>Albeit all the efforts to improve my OI skills, I still died in the Team Formation Test for HKOI squad. I came like 11th in the Junior Division, which was very, very bad for me - Mr Chan told me compete in the Junior Division (for those without context, HKOI is a OI contest, where each school could send up to 8 contestants each in Junior and Senior Divisions).</p> <p>At least, I have worked hard to improve my OI skills, but still, I could not achieve what I should achieve. Really sad for that.</p> <p>However, after all, my focus is not OI, but MO and LO. Best of luck to me in my MO and LO career.</p> <h2 id="academics">Academics</h2> <p>I still maintained a good academic performance this year (at least true before I transferred to DBS - I donâ€™t know my Midyear Exam scores yet). I got a few scholarships, which is quite great.</p> <p>I do not do IB. The tuition fees for IB is too high and I am not really capable of doing IBDP - I am not a good presenter and my speaking skills are bad. I chose Physics, Chemistry, Economics and M2 as my DSE electives (I am not doing 4 electives despite the fact that the HKEAA now allows it in the 2025 HKDSE Exam). In my opinion, they are easier (to study, and to get level 5**) than other electives. The reason that I did not choose Biology is that I am not good in Biology.</p> <p>I am doing equally well in Physics and Economics. F4 Physics is easy to me since I do PhO, which helped me a lot. F4 Economics is also easy to me, since I have learned some Economics concepts in F3 (my old school has a subject which is the combination of Economics and BAFS). Chemistry is not so easy to me, but it is also fine.</p> <p>I wish to get top 3 in Form this year. Best of luck to me! :D</p> <h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2> <h3 id="sspdosa">SSPDOSA</h3> <p>SSPDOSA is quite a nice experience to me.</p> <p>I remember I joined SSPDOSA when a teacher in MYC told me to join it. I filled in the form and I was eligible to do the Heats, but SSPDOSA skill issued and could not send an email to me notifying that. Luckily, I watched my friendâ€™s status and noticed that, and after some moment, I could do the heats.</p> <p>Later, I qualified the finals, before that, I had to join a camp on 4th June (yes I remembered the date exactly). I knew some new people, and the â€˜group parentsâ€™ were quite nice. The detective games were quite fun as well.</p> <p>However, I fried in the finals, which was very bad. I was completely disappointed when I knew I got Commendable Students Award only. I was really depressed for a while. Imagine the Outstanding Students could join KROSA and got awardsâ€¦</p> <p>After that, there were activities organized by the SSPDOSA to join before the Award Ceremony. However, due to time clash with other activities (mainly IMO Training), I had to give up the opportunities to join the activities. Therefore, 80% of the people in the SSPDOSA are unknown to me.</p> <p>It is a pity that I could not get the Outstanding Students Award, and I missed so many activities.</p> <h3 id="musescore">MuseScore</h3> <p>I am an avid MuseScore user. I sometimes arrange scores in MuseScore and upload them to musescore.org, which is nice.</p> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>2022 was a fruitful year. I got many thing throughout the year.</p> <p>Anyways, thanks for reading, and hope we all can flourish in the year of 2023! :D</p> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> Â© Copyright 2022 Mason Chan.
